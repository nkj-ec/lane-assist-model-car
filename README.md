# Raspberry Pi 5 Autonomous Lane Assist Car

This project contains the Python code required to run a model car with a Raspberry Pi 5, an L298N motor driver, and a camera (Pi Camera V2/V3 or USB WebCam).

## Features
- **Motor Control**: Interfacing the L298N via `gpiozero` which is natively compatible with the Pi 5's RP1 I/O chip.
- **Lane Detection**: Canny Edge detection + Hough Line Transform using `OpenCV`.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Plug-and-play support for a MobileNet SSD DNN or fallback pure Computer Vision contour-based checking.
- **Traffic Sign Detection**: Haar cascade implementation to halt at stop signs.

## Hardware Wiring
### L298N to Raspberry Pi 5
- **INT1**: GPIO 24  
- **INT2**: GPIO 23  
- **ENA**:  GPIO 25 (PWM capable)  
- **INT3**: GPIO 22  
- **INT4**: GPIO 27  
- **ENB**:  GPIO 17 (PWM capable)  

*(You can easily change these pins in `main.py` when initializing `Car()`)*

## Environment Setup

1. **Enable Camera Interfaces**: Ensure your camera is enabled via `sudo raspi-config` (Or automatically works dynamically on Pi 5 via `rpicam`/`libcamera`). We are using `Picamera2` (the official Python rpicam library) to capture frames natively.
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
# Strongly recommended to create a virtual environment first
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Get Models (Optional but highly recommended)**:
   - **Stop Sign**: Download a stop sign haarcascade (`stop_data.xml`) and place it in the same directory. E.g., from [OpenCV Haar cascaded lists](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).
   - **Obstacle Detection**: Check out TensorFlow's or Caffe's `MobileNet SSD` pre-trained models. Edit the `ObstacleDetector` constructor in `main.py` with the paths if using.

## Running the Code
Run the code headless or via a terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```

> **Note**: Displaying `cv2.imshow()` on the Pi consumes CPU and decreases FPS. If operating entirely autonomously, it's recommended to leave it commented out in `main.py`.
